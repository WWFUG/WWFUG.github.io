## Short Biography

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU).
I am a second-year Master's student at the Graduate Institute of Electronic Engineering at NTU and expect to obtain my master's degree in July 2024.
I am currently applying for ECE/CS PhD programs for Fall 2024.

I have worked with my advisor [Prof. Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/) on decision procedures and electronic design automation (EDA) since 2020. I also worked with [Dr. Yu-Fang Chen](https://bull.iis.sinica.edu.tw/yfc/doku.php) on neural network testing.

My research interests are decision procedures (QBF/SAT solving), formal verification, model checking, and EDA.

To know more about me, please find my CV [here](../files/CV.pdf).
