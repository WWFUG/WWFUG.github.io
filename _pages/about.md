## Short Biography

I am a first-year ECE PhD student at Princeton University. I received my B.S. and M.S. from National Taiwan University (NTU).
During my Master's study, I was advised by [Prof. Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/) on decision procedures and electronic design automation (EDA).

My research interests include automated reasoning, formal verification, and hardware security.

Please find my CV [here](../files/CV.pdf) to learn more about me.
